# NVIDIAControlDevice

Remotely control an NVIDIA shield via Bluetooth from HTTP/Websockets 

**SUPERSEDED BY NVIDIAControlDevice2**

This software runs on an ESP32 making it into a virtual keyboard running a Kodi style websocket server, this allows clients to connect via any of the standard Kodi remote control tools, such as:
* Kassi (Chrome)
* Yatse/Kore (Android)

#### Supported Hardware
* ESP32

#### Installation
This requires the https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets websockets library and the inbuilt Arduino_JSON by Arduino library, please ensure you change the ssid, password and port numbers in the top of the INO file

#### Limitations
* Unfortuntely, this does not support authentication for its websocket, as the remote control applications do not currently support this, instead this relies on security through obscurity only allowing connections to the correct path and blocks a client from connecting for five minutes, if it connects to the wrong path 5 times.
* I managed to get the time for an action down to 15ms, if you know of any ways to improve this, please submit a patch.
